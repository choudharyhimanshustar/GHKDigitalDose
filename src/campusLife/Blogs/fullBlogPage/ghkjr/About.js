          This is a brief note to let you know how committed, I am to make this junior college of commerce a good Institution. I can’t do my best teaching without your help so I am sharing a list of things which can make this a better experience for all of us and make commerce faculty an interesting course to study and pursue.
<br /> <br/>
Be along with me: When you are in the class, I need you completely there... just physical presence is not important. I want you to be mentally and emotionally present – listening, taking notes, asking questions, sometimes looking surprised or confused or amused. This will surely give me my feed back –and help me to improvise and become a better teacher. I am there because of you.
<br /> <br/>
Participate: Speak when you have something to speak. Ask a thoughtful question, share a relevant experience, respond to another student’s comment or voice a different perspective, this will help you to grow and develop. Be alert and aware. Be sensitive to your environment. Spend time to look within and introspect.
<br /> <br/>
Help me get to know you: Let start with names, I am committed to learning yours and do hope you will learn mine. I’d like to get to know you beyond just your name. Why did you choose commerce stream? What are you future ambitions? I do my best teaching when I have students who have dreams, goals and ambitions. Think big and aspire for becoming something. Make a difference to yourself and to this world.</p>
