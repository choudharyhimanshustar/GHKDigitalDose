          We try our best to inculcate good habits in our students, i.e. punctuality, obedience, respect for elders, dutifulness, diligence in work, independence and many other virtues which they aspire and which will help them to be responsible students.
In our institution 'Guru Harkrishan High School' primary teachers work very hard to develop a positive self esteem in students. We encourage them to inculcate moral values.
With our innovative and new methods of teaching, which is application based, we teach through illustrations and relate to real life situation. Thus making teaching interesting and learner-centric.
Scrap books, charts and other art work are all done by students under the guidance of the subject teachers. The school feels duly responsible for the overall development and progress of the students. A lot of effort is taken at all levels to look into the growth of the students be it in the area of sports or technological learning. Each student is given a computer to work on. Theory and practical teaching is imparted by our expert computer teachers.
In keeping with the changing scenario efforts are made to teach the children the importance of environment and conservation of natural resources.
<br />The diction 'Health Is wealth' is truly emphasized by imparting to them information on dietary habits. We ensure that our students also have a practical experience. For this we even help them to prepare tasty and healthy food in school. At our school in Guru Harkrishan we discourage parents to pack fast foods in the children’s tiffins. We educate the parents on this aspect through talks and seminars in school.
We involve parents in different activities of this school. Students are encouraged to celebrate the spring festival, the handicraft festival, the monsoon cultural festivals and they present items related to the Indian seasons and festivals. Our school does not believe in imparting bookish knowledge. In fact we believe that children should be close to nature to have a real life experience and hand-on experience.
We also encourage our students to go for state level competitive examinations to help students to gain confidence and in future enable them to face the challenges of life.
Our school takes regular classes for calligraphy to improvise on the concept of handwriting in creative manner. Calligraphy is a visual art related to writing. In today’s times of computers, people often ask the question as why calligraphy? Handwriting infact speaks a lot about a person’s character. Calligraphy is an expression of our innate creativity and this is what distinguishes us from other species.
At Guru Harkrishan we strive hard to enrich the minds of our children with love and kindness.
Last but not the least the boy scouts and Girl Guide programme introduced in the school is a step towards teaching the children civic responsibilities and independence. Teachers in our school are fully involved and passionate about their work and feel responsible in building the character of the students.
<br />At Guru Harkrishan we believe that the best is still to come and we have to strive hard to achieve it. Each day is a new day with new horizons to be explored and new things to be learnt on the path of progress.
With the wonderful team of teacher and under the guidance of our director Dr. Lakhbir Kaur and our principal Mrs. Manjeet Kaur Anand our school is surely going leaps and bounds on the path of progress.
