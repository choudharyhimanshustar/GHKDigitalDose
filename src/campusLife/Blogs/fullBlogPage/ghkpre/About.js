          My team i.e. the staff of my school is very friendly, warm and affectionate. We always encourage our pupils to develop self-confidence and self-esteem. We encourage them to work, within the guidelines of early childhood education. We make sure that the child develops his/her own special abilities, becomes self reliant and independent.
Every child is unique and deserves the best possible start in life. Early education has to be positive and we are aware that it is most crucial in the development of the child and we encourage the child to adopt a positive attitude towards learning to stimulate his senses, for faster growth and development. Some children may learn while quietly playing with blocks, while some may even learn by lazily doodling while some others may learn by hand painting that could add to their memory while some may learn just by listening.
Pre-schools give an opportunity for kids to interact and learn with other kids and build bonds that could last for a lifetime. Two important lessons learnt by children at this stage are: Co-operation and Trust.
The play way method is a flexible one based on child's interest and aptitude. It is a conscious plan to encourage complete freedom of expression. Play way method helps children follow certain aspects of development such as linguistic, logical, physical, aesthetic, creative & social. Fine and gross motor skills makes learning easy and enjoyable. Each child is given equal opportunity for full participation. This method not only inculcates knowledge but also skills. Pupils find satisfaction at the cognitive level. Our attempt is to create apt learning environment and pave ways of self-discipline. This provides more opportunities for learning and helps children connect with their teachers easily.
Our Pre-Primary children in the Nursery, Jr. K.G. and Sr. K.G. years are already trained for speech making, recitation, singing, dancing and participating in skits. By the time they finish three years with us they are fully ready for a full fledged course in the primary section of the school.
Our motto Play and Learn.
